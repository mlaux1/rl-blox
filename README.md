# Modular RL

This project contains modular implementations of various model-free and 
model-based RL algorithms and consists of deep neural network-based as 
well as tabular representation of Q-Values, policies, etc. which can be 
used interchangeably. The goal of this project is for the authors to 
learn by reimplementing various RL algorithms and possible to eventually 
an algorithmic toolbox for research purposes.
